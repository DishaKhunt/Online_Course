    <h2>JavaScript Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- 
        Variable Names:-
        => we use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions).
        => All names start with a letter.
     -->
    <h3>Variable Names</h3>
    <p id="demo1"></p>

    <!-- 
            Spaces Around Operators: 
            => Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas
    -->
    <h3>Spaces Around Operators</h3>

    <!-- 
        Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks
     -->
    <h3>Code Indentation</h3>
    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <!-- 
         Statement Rules:
           => General rules for simple statements:
                -Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.

           => General rules for complex (compound) statements:
                -Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
                -Use one space before the opening bracket.
                -Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
                -Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.
     -->
     <h3>Statement Rules</h3>
    <p id="demo3"></p>

    <!-- 
        Object Rules:
        => General rules for object definitions:

            -Place the opening bracket on the same line as the object name.
            -Use colon plus one space between each property and its value.
            -Use quotes around string values, not around numeric values.
            -Do not add a comma after the last property-value pair.
            -Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
            -Always end an object definition with a semicolon.
     -->

     <!-- 
        Line Length < 80: 
        => For readability, avoid lines longer than 80 characters.

        => If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator or a comma.
      -->
      <h3>Line Length &lt; 80 </h3>
    <p id="demo4"></p>

    <!-- 
        Naming Conventions:
        => Variable and function names written as camelCase
        => Global variables written in UPPERCASE (We don't, but it's quite common)
        => Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE

        => Hyphens in HTML and CSS:
            -HTML5 attributes can start with data- (data-quantity, data-price).
            -CSS uses hyphens in property-names (font-size).

        => Underscores:
            -Many programmers prefer to use underscores (date_of_birth), especially in SQL databases.
            -Underscores are often used in PHP documentation.

        => PascalCase:
           - PascalCase is often preferred by C programmers.

        => camelCase:
            -camelCase is used by JavaScript itself, by jQuery, and other JavaScript libraries.
     -->

     <!-- 
        Loading JavaScript in HTML
        Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the type attribute is not necessary):
        ex: 
            <script src="myscript.js"></script>
      -->

      <!-- 
        Accessing HTML Elements:
            => A consequence of using "untidy" HTML styles, might result in JavaScript errors.

            => These two JavaScript statements will produce different results:

            example: 
            const obj = getElementById("Demo")
            const obj = getElementById("demo")
       -->

       <!-- 
        File Extensions:
         => HTML files should have a .html extension (.htm is allowed).

         => CSS files should have a .css extension.

         => JavaScript files should have a .js extension.
        -->

        <!-- 
            Use Lower Case File Names
            => Most web servers (Apache, Unix) are case sensitive about file names:

            => london.jpg cannot be accessed as London.jpg.

            => Other web servers (Microsoft, IIS) are not case sensitive:

            => london.jpg can be accessed as London.jpg or london.jpg.

            => If you use a mix of upper and lower case, you have to be extremely consistent.

            => If you move from a case insensitive, to a case sensitive server, even small errors can break your web site.

            => To avoid these problems, always use lower case file names
